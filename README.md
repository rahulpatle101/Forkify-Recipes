# Forkify-Recipes - A Recipe finder web app

Forkify is a recipe finder app built using [Food2Fork api](https://www.food2fork.com/about/api) 

As a side project, I followed and learned from [Jonas Schmedtman](https://codingheroes.io/) about how master JavaScript and build a web app which pulls data from an open API and has following features:

## Features:
1. Search for recipe
2. Show details for a recipe
3. Add recipe to your favorite list

## Things I learned: 
1. MVC architecture
2. ES6
3. Webpack 
4. Babel
5. Async Await Axios calls to API
6. BEM Architecture
7. Local Storage
